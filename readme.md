# Self Avoiding Billiards #
Generates images indicating where self avoiding billiards are likely to get trapped. Based on a paper by Thijs Albers, Stijn Delnoij, Nico Schramma and Maziyar Jalaal

The generated TIFF images are in 32bit grayscale mode. Not every picture viewer can handle these. I suggest to use [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) to post process the images.
